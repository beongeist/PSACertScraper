# PSACertScraper
Scrape PSA Card Certs using Selenium Base

# To Start
Make sure all imports used in n_certs.py are installed
Run n_certs.py

You will be prompted to use Mode 1 or 2. 
Mode 1 allows you to set up a starting cert and it will scrape by incrementing from that cert. The length sets how many certs you want to scrape. All certs scraped are saved in a CSV
Mode 2 is used when you already have an existing CSV. Mode 2 will automatically start at the latest cert scraped in the CSV.
